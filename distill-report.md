# Knowledge Base Distillation Report

*Generated: 2025-09-11*

## Automated Changes

The following issues were automatically fixed during distillation:

### 1. Removed Duplicate Files
- **Deleted**: `.claude/knowledge/KNOWLEDGE_MAP.md` (duplicate of KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md)
  - Both files had identical structure with only syntax differences (@ prefix vs relative paths)
  - Kept KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md as it's referenced in INSTRUCTIONS.md

### 2. Fixed Human Points Multiplier Conflict
- **File**: `api/human_points.md`
  - Changed default multiplier from "2x" to "1x" (line 12)
  - Removed redundant Rust implementation details (lines 47-74)
  - Added reference to `gotchas/human_points_implementation.md` for implementation details

### 3. Resolved Nullifier Handling Contradiction
- **File**: `gotchas/nullifier_handling.md`
  - Clarified section title from "Nullifier Multi vs Single Mode" to "Python Nullifier Feature Flag"
  - Removed contradictory statement about Rust respecting the feature flag (line 7)

### 4. Removed Outdated Phase 2 Troubleshooting
- **File**: `gotchas/django_model_discrepancies.md`
  - Removed entire Phase 2 section (lines 3-42) with outdated discovery notes
  - Kept only the confirmed Phase 7 Django table schema

### 5. Consolidated Provider Deduplication Info
- **File**: `patterns/deduplication.md`
  - Replaced redundant provider deduplication section with reference to `gotchas/score_calculation.md`

### 6. Fixed Broken External Reference
- **File**: `gotchas/event_data_structure.md`
  - Removed broken reference to non-existent `RUST_MIGRATION_PLAN.md:882`
  - Kept only valid reference to `api/registry/models.py`

### 7. Updated Knowledge Map
- **File**: `KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md`
  - Added missing entry for `@gotchas/human_points_implementation.md`
  - Updated descriptions to be more accurate and concise

## Requires Review

The following issues require human decision for resolution:

### 1. Architecture File Status
**Issue**: Phase completion information spread across multiple files
**Location**: `architecture/scoring_flow.md` contains comprehensive phase status (1-8 complete), but individual knowledge files reference phases as if incomplete
**Current State**: Mixed messaging about what's implemented vs what's planned
**Options**:
a) Keep architecture/scoring_flow.md as authoritative source, update other files to reference it
b) Remove phase-specific implementation details from individual knowledge files
c) Create a separate MIGRATION_STATUS.md file for tracking phase completion

### 2. Human Points Implementation Location
**Issue**: Detailed Rust implementation in both api and gotchas directories
**Location**: `api/human_points.md` vs `gotchas/human_points_implementation.md`
**Current State**: Some overlap but gotchas file has more Rust-specific details
**Options**:
a) Keep API file for interface/behavior, gotchas for implementation details (current approach)
b) Merge all into api/human_points.md
c) Create separate rust/ directory for all Rust-specific implementation details

<!-- USER INPUT END -->

### 3. File Reference Cleanup Strategy
**Issue**: Many files end with extensive "See: file1, file2, file3..." references
**Location**: Most knowledge files
**Current State**: References often overlap and may become stale
**Options**:
a) Remove all file references, rely on KNOWLEDGE_MAP_CLAUDE.md for navigation
b) Keep only the most relevant 1-2 references per file
c) Leave as-is for comprehensive cross-referencing

## Summary

- **Files Modified**: 7
- **Lines Removed**: ~80
- **Duplicates Eliminated**: 1 complete file, multiple content sections
- **Contradictions Resolved**: 3
- **Broken References Fixed**: 1

The knowledge base is now cleaner and more consistent. Once review items are addressed, the documentation will be significantly more maintainable and reliable.
