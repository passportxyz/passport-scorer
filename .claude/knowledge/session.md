### [14:07] [architecture] Phase 1 implementation requirements
**Details**: Phase 1 requires a Rust implementation of the `/v2/stamps/{scorer_id}/score/{address}` endpoint with:

1. Data Flow:
- Entry: AWS Lambda handler in v2/aws_lambdas/stamp_score_GET.py
- Calls handle_scoring_for_account() in v2/api/api_stamps.py
- Creates/updates Passport and Score records
- Calls ascore_passport() from registry/atasks.py
- Loads credentials from ceramic_cache table (filter: deleted_at IS NULL, no revocation)
- Validates credentials with didkit
- Runs LIFO deduplication via alifo()
- Calculates weighted score
- Returns V2ScoreResponse

2. Key Simplifications for Rust:
- Only support nullifiers array (no hash field support)
- Process ALL nullifiers (no FF_MULTI_NULLIFIER feature flag)
- Credentials must have 1+ nullifiers in array

3. Django Compatibility Requirements:
- Must write exact same data structure to existing tables
- Score.evidence field format: {"type": "ThresholdScoreCheck", "success": bool, "rawScore": string, "threshold": string}
- Score.stamps field: dict with provider -> {score, dedup, expiration_date}
- Score.stamp_scores field: provider -> weight mapping (only valid stamps, not deduped ones)
- Binary score: 1 if sum >= threshold, else 0
- Create SCORE_UPDATE event after score save (Django uses pre_save signal)

4. LIFO Deduplication:
- 5-retry mechanism for IntegrityError on concurrent requests
- Stamp is deduped if ANY nullifier clashes with existing hash links
- Backfill non-clashing nullifiers with clashing owner's data
- Only first stamp per provider contributes to score

5. Human Points (required for v1):
- Check community.human_points_program flag
- Record passing scores, stamp actions, scoring bonus (4+ communities)
- MetaMask OG bonus for specific provider

### [14:16] [architecture] Rust Phase 1 Implementation Complete
**Details**: Successfully completed Phase 1 of Rust migration for Passport Scorer v2 endpoint.

Created complete data model architecture with:
1. Clean internal models (StampData, ScoringResult) for business logic
2. Django-compatible database structs matching existing tables exactly
3. V2 API response types with 5 decimal place formatting
4. Translation layers to convert between clean models and Django formats
5. Comprehensive unit tests (7 tests, all passing)

Key architectural decisions:
- Separation of concerns: Clean models for logic, Django compatibility only at boundaries
- Future-ready with to_scoring_event() method for event-driven architecture
- Type safety ensuring correct transformations
- Single source of truth - one model generates all output formats

Project structure created at /workspace/project/rust-scorer/ with full Cargo.toml dependencies and modular code organization.

Critical Django compatibility maintained:
- Evidence field format: {"type": "ThresholdScoreCheck", "success": bool, "rawScore": string, "threshold": string}
- Stamps dict includes all stamps (deduped with score="0.00000")
- stamp_scores only includes valid stamps for scoring
- Binary score is exactly 1 or 0 as Decimal type

Ready for Phase 2: Database Layer implementation.

### [14:46] [gotcha] Django model field verification needed
**Details**: User questioned the Django model changes made in Phase 2. The changes included adding timestamp fields (created_at, updated_at) and modifying field names/types to match what the database queries expect. These changes were made based on the SQL queries in read_ops.rs and write_ops.rs, but weren't verified against the actual Django models in the Python codebase. Need to cross-check with actual Django model definitions to ensure accuracy.

### [14:48] [architecture] Django model field verification results
**Details**: After checking the actual Django models, found several discrepancies in the Rust Django model structs:

1. **CeramicCache**: Has many additional fields not in Rust model - proof_value, type, compose_db fields, issuance_date, expiration_date, source fields. The Rust model is missing these but they may not be needed for scoring.

2. **BinaryWeightedScorer**: The actual model inherits from Scorer and doesn't have created_at/updated_at fields directly. It has: scorer_ptr_id (FK to Scorer), weights (JSONField), threshold (DecimalField).

3. **HashScorerLink**: Does NOT have created_at/updated_at fields in Django. Only has: hash, community (FK), address, expires_at with unique_together on hash+community.

4. **AccountAPIKey**: Has many rate limit fields not in Rust model - rate_limit, analysis_rate_limit, embed_rate_limit. Missing historical_endpoint field.

5. **Community**: Has account (FK), deleted_at, and other fields. Does have created_at but NOT updated_at.

6. **Customization**: Has scorer field as OneToOneField to Community, not community_id. Has many more fields for UI customization.

The Rust models were created based on what the SQL queries expect, but some fields added (like created_at/updated_at) don't actually exist in Django models. This could cause runtime SQL errors when querying non-existent columns.
