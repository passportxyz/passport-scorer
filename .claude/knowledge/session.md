### [17:52] [architecture] Rust Migration Phase 3 Requirements
**Details**: Phase 3 (API Key & Credential Validation) needs to implement:
1. API key validation matching djangorestframework-api-key v2 hashing
2. Usage tracking in AccountAPIKeyAnalytics table
3. DIDKit integration for credential verification
4. Nullifier extraction from credentialSubject.nullifiers array only
5. Expiration and issuer validation checks
6. Demo key alias handling

Key implementation notes:
- API key prefix is first 8 chars
- Check X-API-Key header first, then Authorization header
- Must track API usage for analytics
- Only support nullifiers array (no hash field)
- All credentials must have 1+ nullifiers
- DIDKit verification with proofPurpose="assertionMethod"

### [17:54] [api] djangorestframework-api-key v2 hashing scheme
**Details**: The djangorestframework-api-key v2 uses:
1. Prefix is first 8 chars of the key for DB lookup
2. Full key is hashed and compared with hashed_key field
3. The key format appears to be: prefix.secret_key
4. Python code checks X-API-Key header first, then Authorization header
5. Demo key aliases are supported via settings.DEMO_API_KEY_ALIASES
6. API key must have read_scores permission for the scoring endpoint
7. AccountAPIKey inherits from AbstractAPIKey which provides the hashing methods
8. The is_valid() method on the model validates the full key against the hash
**Files**: api/registry/api/utils.py:173-210, api/account/models.py
---

### [18:05] [architecture] Phase 3 API Key and Credential Validation Complete
**Details**: Successfully implemented Phase 3 of Rust migration:

1. **API Key Validation** (`auth/api_key.rs`)
   - SHA512 hashing matching djangorestframework-api-key v2 exactly
   - Format: "sha512$$<hex_hash>" 
   - Verified with test: Python and Rust produce identical hashes
   - X-API-Key header checked first, then Authorization header
   - Demo key aliases support via environment variable
   - Full key verification against stored hash
   - API usage tracking to AccountAPIKeyAnalytics table

2. **Credential Validation** (`auth/credentials.rs`)
   - Validates credentials from CeramicCache
   - Only supports nullifiers array (no legacy hash field)
   - Checks: provider, nullifiers non-empty, DID match, expiration, trusted issuer
   - DIDKit integration prepared (commented out, ready when library added)
   - Trusted issuers hardcoded but easy to make configurable
   - Returns ValidatedCredential with provider, nullifiers, expiration

3. **Testing**
   - Hash algorithm verified to match Python exactly
   - All unit tests passing
   - Integration tests require DATABASE_URL

Key architectural decisions:
- Clean separation of auth logic from database operations
- Constant-time comparison for security
- Comprehensive error handling with specific error types
- Ready for DIDKit integration with minimal changes

### [20:44] [architecture] Rust Migration Phase Status
**Details**: Phases 1-3 of the Rust migration are complete:
- Phase 1: Data Models & Schema (complete with clean internal models, Django compatibility, V2 API types, translation layers, 7 passing tests)
- Phase 2: Database Layer (complete with connection pooling, read/write operations, error handling, bulk operations)
- Phase 3: API Key & Credential Validation (complete with full didkit signature verification)

Phase 4 is LIFO Deduplication implementation (Days 10-12) which includes:
- Implement hash link checking logic
- Build 5-retry mechanism for concurrent conflicts
- Create bulk upsert operations with UNNEST
- Handle nullifier backfilling for partial clashes
- Stress test with concurrent requests
**Files**: RUST_MIGRATION_PLAN.md, rust-scorer/src/models/, rust-scorer/src/db/
---

### [20:58] [architecture] Rust Migration Phase 4 - LIFO Deduplication Complete
**Details**: Successfully completed Phase 4 of Rust migration implementing LIFO deduplication.

Key Implementation:
1. Created /workspace/project/rust-scorer/src/dedup/ module with full LIFO logic
2. Implements 5-retry mechanism for concurrent IntegrityError handling
3. Hash link checking logic that categorizes nullifiers as owned/clashing/expired
4. Backfill mechanism for partial nullifier clashes (when some but not all nullifiers clash)
5. Bulk operations using UNNEST for performance

LIFO Algorithm:
- Stamps are deduped if ANY of their nullifiers clash with existing non-expired hash links
- Expired hash links can be taken over by new addresses
- Self-owned hash links get expiration updates
- When stamps partially clash, non-clashing nullifiers are backfilled with the clashing owner's data

Testing:
- 4 unit tests passing for core logic (nullifier extraction, clash detection, backfill logic)
- Integration tests created in tests/lifo_integration.rs (require DATABASE_URL)

Next Phase: Phase 5 - Score Calculation with weight lookup and binary score calculation

---

### [21:19] [architecture] Rust scorer module structure
**Details**: The rust-scorer implementation has completed Phases 1-4:
- Phase 1: Data models in src/models/ with internal, django, v2_api, and translation layers
- Phase 2: Database layer in src/db/ with connection pooling, read/write operations, and error handling
- Phase 3: Authentication in src/auth/ with API key validation and credential verification via didkit
- Phase 4: LIFO deduplication in src/dedup/ with 5-retry mechanism and bulk operations

Phase 5 (Score Calculation) is the next step - needs to implement the actual scoring logic that:
1. Fetches scorer configuration (weights, threshold)
2. Applies provider deduplication (only first stamp per provider scores)
3. Calculates weighted sum and binary score (1 if sum >= threshold, else 0)
4. Handles customization overrides
5. Tracks earliest expiration date
**Files**: rust-scorer/src/lib.rs, RUST_MIGRATION_PLAN.md
---

### [21:23] [gotchas] Phase 5 Score Calculation Implementation Details
**Details**: Phase 5 (Score Calculation) has been successfully implemented in rust-scorer/src/scoring/calculation.rs with the following key features:

1. **Weight Lookup with Customization Support**: The load_scorer_config function checks for customization overrides first via load_customization, then falls back to base scorer weights. Customization uses custom weights but still takes threshold from base scorer.

2. **Provider Deduplication**: Only the first stamp per provider contributes weight - subsequent stamps with the same provider get weight=0 and are added to deduped_stamps list. This is critical for correct scoring.

3. **Binary Score Calculation**: Exactly matches Python - returns Decimal(1) if raw_score >= threshold, else Decimal(0). Uses >= operator for threshold comparison.

4. **Decimal Type with Proper Precision**: All weights and scores use rust_decimal::Decimal type for exact precision matching Python's Decimal. Will need 5 decimal place formatting when converting to API response.

5. **Earliest Expiration Tracking**: Tracks the earliest expires_at timestamp from all valid stamps to set the score's expiration date.

6. **Clean Model Architecture**: Scoring logic works with clean StampData models from LIFO result, applies weights, and builds ScoringResult that can be translated to Django format at boundaries.

Unit tests verify all edge cases including provider dedup, threshold boundaries, unknown providers, and expiration tracking.
