### [19:02] [tools] Log analyzer tool removal
**Details**: The custom log-analyzer tool at rust-scorer/src/bin/log-analyzer.rs will be removed as part of the telemetry migration. It was a custom tool built to parse JSON tracing logs and generate ASCII flame charts, but it's being replaced with proper OpenTelemetry distributed tracing that exports to Jaeger/X-Ray for professional visualization.
**Files**: rust-scorer/src/bin/log-analyzer.rs, rust-scorer/TELEMETRY_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
