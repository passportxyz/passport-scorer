## Gitcoin Passport Trusted User App

This is a simple demo app that shows how to use the Scorer API to retrieve user scores and stamps
from Gitcoin passport. The app is built in Nextjs using `create-next-app` and Chakra-UI.

## Getting Started

This repository contains source code to accompany a "trusted user app" walkthrough tutorial at [docs.gitcoin.co](https://docs.passport.gitcoin.co/building-with-passport/integration-guides/integrating-stamps-and-scorers).

You can find step-by-step instructions for setting up and running this app in the tutorial.

## Quick start

First clone this repository, then navigate to the new `check-trusted-user` directory and install the project dependencies:

`npm install`

Then, run the app locally using the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You will need a web3 wallet, ideally one that already owns a Gitcoin Passport with several
stamps. Otherwise, you won't be able to do very much with this app!

There is a walkthrough tutorial for this app coming soon...
