# Gitcoin Passport gating app

This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

This is a simple demo app that shows how to use the Scorer API to retrieve user scores and stamps from Gitcoin passport. The app is built in Nextjs using create-next-app and Chakra-UI.

## Getting Started

This repository contains source code to accompany a "passport gating" walkthrough tutorial at docs.gitcoin.co.

You can find step-by-step instructions for setting up and running this app in the tutorial.

## Quick start

First clone this repository, then navigate to the new check-trusted-user directory and install the project dependencies:

```sh
npm install
```

Then, run the app locally using the development server:

```sh
npm run dev
```

Open `http://localhost:3000` with your browser to see the result.

You will need a web3 wallet, ideally one that already owns a Gitcoin Passport with several stamps. Otherwise, you won't be able to do very much with this app!

There is a walkthrough tutorial for this app coming soon...
