# Gitcoin Passports Scorer API

The Gitcoin Passport API allows developers to integrate identity verification
functionality into their applications. The API provides a simple way to read and
score the identities of Gitcoin Passport holders by applying scoring mechanisms
to verifiable credentials.

Social organizations have a difficult time ensuring that each participant is
unique: that they are in fact human (not a bot) and also a unique participant
(not double counting). The Gitcoin Passport solves this by providing
a solution that is decentralized and recognizes the intersectional and social
nature of identity.

The Passport Scorer API (this repository) is a centralized service provided by
Gitcoin to make it easier to read and work with Passport scores.
