# Passport XYZ's Scorer API

The Passport API allows developers to integrate identity verification functionality into their applications. The API provides a simple way to read and score the identities of Gitcoin Passport holders by applying scoring mechanisms to verifiable credentials.

Social organizations have a difficult time ensuring that each participant is unique: that they are in fact human (not a bot) and also a unique participant (not double counting). The Gitcoin Passport solves this by providing a solution that is decentralized and recognizes the intersectional and social nature of identity.

The Passport Scorer API (this repository) is a centralized service provided by Passport XYZ to make it easier to read and work with Passport scores.
